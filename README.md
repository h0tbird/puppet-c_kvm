# r10k-kvm
This is an `R10K` control repository used to setup an hypervisor layer.

On top of this layer `Booddies` deploys a `CoreOS` cluster.

Some configuration files are generated by `Puppet` and consumed by `CoreOS`.

The files are exposed to `CoreOS` using a virtualization-aware file system pass-through.

YAML is used as a `Hiera` backend to store the configuration data.

```
[root@kvm-1 ~]# puppet facts find kvm-1.cell-0.dc-1.demo.lan | jq '.values.fqdn_3'
"cell-0"
```
